# Intelligent-Tourism-Recommendation-System
The aim of this paper is to give the user a friendly and useful framework for tourism recommendation. 

We used photographs to show users fascinating scenes from around the world and to assist them in finding hotels that better matched their interests. 

We provided the user both morning and evening attractions along with price, location and rating on the basis of the user’s selected categories 
which are also rated by the user. 

For hotels we ask the user to select 5 amenities and then the hotel suggestions are provided along with ratings, reviews, address and price. 

The result is aimed to be consistent with the user’s amenity requirements.
